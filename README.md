# Health-Insurance-Cost-Predictor

A machine learning-based web application that predicts health insurance costs based on user inputs such as age, BMI, and other health-related factors. This tool utilizes models like XGBoost and scikit-learn to generate predictions. Built using Python and Streamlit for the frontend, it offers an intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

### 1. Introduction
The goal of the Health Insurance Cost Predictor project is to develop a user-friendly web application that predicts health insurance costs based on key personal factors such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), smoking habits, and other health-related inputs. The prediction is powered by machine learning models trained on a dataset of health records. By using this application, users can easily estimate their potential insurance costs, which helps them understand how certain factors influence the cost of their health coverage.

### 2. Features:

* Accepts user input for age, BMI, and other health factors.
* Predicts insurance costs based on the input.
* Easy-to-use web interface.
